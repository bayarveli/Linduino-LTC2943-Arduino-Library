# Linduino-LTC2943-Arduino-Library
Linear Technology has Linduino platform which is Arduino compatible. The Linduino Library ( can be downloaded from [here] (http://www.linear.com/docs/43958) ) has developed for use of this platform.

Here, the library is filtered for LTC2943 battery management IC. A modification about resetting alert status is added to the library.

Similarly, the orijinal application code is written for DC1812A demo board and will be downloaded from this [link](http://www.linear.com/docs/44319). A few modifications are made:
- Resetting alert status is added.
- Demo board dependencies are removed to use the application code for any LTC2943 hardware + Arduino platform.

Updated library and application is tested with Arduino Uno and newly designed LTC2943 battery management card. [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QU0Dwb8aWI) for the test video. For more information, check the [blog](http://www.velibayar.net/).
